# Five-Finger-Robotic-Hand
## Instructions
1. Home the hand.
2. Run Reset_EEPROM to let the Arduino know that we're at 0 rotations.
3. Program your desired hand function.

## Running
These codes are designed to be able to stop and remember their location via a stop button. This button will save the robot's current position for when we want to restart it. There are currently some bugs which I aim to resolve later.
